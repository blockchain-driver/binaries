Some binaries for demo

In `ethereum` folder there are Go-Ethereum binaries v1.8.2: 
`geth` for Ubuntu Linux
and `geth.exe` for Windows.
Running this executable is enough (no other files are required)
Hint: on Linux make sure that the `geth` has executable attribute:
`chmod +x geth`

There are convenience script to run node and console.
